```javascript
require.config({
    ...
    packages : [
        {
            name : 'masseuse',

    ]
    ...
});
```

## Description

Masseuse is a Backbone helper library that uses RequireJS AMDs.

Masseuse is functional, and documentation and tests are being fleshed out.

Masseuse does five main things:

1. Adds lifecycle methods to Views that are optionally async using jQuery promises.
1. Allows easier separation of Views into a config and functionality sections by providing several shortcut configs.
1. Adds support for adding child Views.
1. Provides Proxy and Computed Properties for Masseuse Models
1. Provides a Masseuse Router extension of the Backbone Router with a before routing callback.

Additionally there is support for append or replacing the `el` of views, optional plugin methods on view initialization,
and a channels singleton for use as an event bus.

## Usage

Look at the tests for example usage. More documentation coming soon.

## Contributing
