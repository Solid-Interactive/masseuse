========

Masseuse is a collection of helpers for Backbone. It includes the following:

* Computed Properties for Models
* Proxy Properties for Models (TODO: coming soon!)
* Model / Collection data binding to the DOM using Rivets
* A simple Finite State Machine that uses `$.Deferred`
* A Channels Backbone event bus for View to View communication
* A custom router
* A mixin pattern that allows functions to be customized with default and actual properties as well as jQuery deferred.
* A BaseView
