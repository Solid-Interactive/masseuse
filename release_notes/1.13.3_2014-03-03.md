    * Renamed the "dollars" formatter to "centsToDollars".

        The Following, if equal to "120" in the model,

        ```html
            <div data-rv-text="model:amount | centsToDollars"></div>
        ```

        will render as

        ```html
            <div data-rv-text="model:amount | centsToDollars">$1.20</div>
        ```

    * Added another formatter, "asDollars", which is slightly different.

        The Following, if equal to "120" in the model,

        ```html
            <div data-rv-text="model:amount | centsToDollars"></div>
        ```

        will render as

        ```html
            <div data-rv-text="model:amount | centsToDollars">$120.00</div>
        ```
