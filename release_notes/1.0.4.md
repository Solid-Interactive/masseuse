* rivets formatters and binders are now called with the scope of the view
* can set Rivets tempalte delimiters using `options.rivetDelimiters`
    * should we namespace the rivets config?
    * why is it all `rivet` and not `rivets`, like the library?
* plugin methods are now called with and argument of options (and still the context of the view)
* the rivets plugin no longer `this.model.set('viewId', this.cid)` for the view
* `rivetFormatters` and `rivetBinders` no longer have to be stored on the view and are consumed from `options` in initialize
* `rivetConfig` is now applied if truthy
