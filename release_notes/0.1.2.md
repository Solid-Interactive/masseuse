* a description of the data-scope is no longer need in the dom for riveted views
    * nothing to do for upgrades, but if you had `rivetConfig.dataScope` is no longer needed, since the views themselves are now being riveted
    * this update does ignore `rivetConfig.dataScope`
* updating release notes
* model getters and setters now support infinite nesting.

```javascript
model.get('object.nestedObject.tripleNestedObject');

model.set('object.nestedObject.tripleNestedObject', 'Right On Nesting!');
```

* proxy properties can now be set on nested models.

```javascript
model1.set('object.nestedObject.tripleNested', 'Papas Emeritus');
model2.set('popeName', new ProxyProperty('object.nestedObject.tripleNested', model1));
console.log(model2.get('popeName')); ==> Papas Emeritus
```
