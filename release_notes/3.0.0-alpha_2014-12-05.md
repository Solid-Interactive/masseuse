    * Upgrading rivets to 0.7.1

    See the rivets [changelog](https://github.com/mikeric/rivets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more detail information:

    In general, there are 4 big changes,

        1.  All of your formatters and binders can take variable arguments. This means that a formatter can take computed values as arguments. For example:

            ```html
            <div>{ model.name | translate model.language }</div>
            ```

        2. Support for primitives. Things like, `new Boolean()` or `new Error()` or `new Date()`.  For example, the following will create and output a new Date object:

            ```html
            <div>{ model.somedate | date }</div>
            ```

        3.  Rivets now listens to the `input` event by default. So, bound inputs will update as the user types. Also, if you were manually triggering change events on a jquery plugin because the plugin did not match HTML events spec, then you might not need to do that anymore, or you might need to re-think your binder.

        4. Removed the `rivetsConfig.instaUpdate` property as it is no longer useful given that rivets will update on the input event now.
