* BaseViews now have a `.refresh()` method.
    * `refresh()` removes the view and all its children and calls start on it again.
    * `refresh()` returns the start promise.
    * `refreshChildren()` calls refresh on each child.
    * `refresh()` and `refreshChildren()` are often useful if start triggers a server data fetch in - for example - `beforeRender()`.
