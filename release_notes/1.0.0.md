* in rivets `model` is available instead of `data`
* default rivets `.` adapter is available for POJSOs
* `:` is available for Backbone Models
    * `->` is used for nested fields in data
* to update replace the following
    * replace `data.` with `model:`
    * replace all dots in references that begin with `model:` with `->`
    * dots in references that do not begin with `model:` should be left as is
    * for now nested models should bind using `model.attributes....attributes...`
* `options.templateHtml` is now `options.template`
* `options.el` can no longer be used to indicate the view to be appended to
    * the `options.appendView` flag is removed
    * instead `options.appendTo` can be used to define the element to append to
        * `options.appendTo` may either be a sizzle selector, DOM element, or jQuery object
    * the `options.el` wrapper div is now created as expected with optional usage of `id`, `className`, `tagName`, `attributes`
        * this resets masseuse to use base Backbone functionality around el
